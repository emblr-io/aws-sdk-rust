/// <p>Engagement members are the participants in an Engagement, which is likely a collaborative project or business opportunity within the AWS partner network. Members can be different partner organizations or AWS accounts that are working together on a specific engagement.</p>
/// <p>Each member is represented by their AWS Account ID, Company Name, and associated details. Members have a status within the Engagement (PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, or WITHDRAWN), indicating their current state of participation. Only existing members of an Engagement can view the list of other members. This implies a level of privacy and access control within the Engagement structure.</p>
